## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, figures_side, echo = FALSE, out.width = '20%', out.height = '20%', fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Confusion Matrices: XGBoost (left), SVM (right)"}
# knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/cm_xgb.png", "figures/cm_svm.png"))
knitr::include_graphics("figures/cm_xgb.png")
knitr::include_graphics("figures/cm_svm.png")
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
